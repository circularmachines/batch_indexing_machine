# Batch Indexing Machine

This initiative is dedicated to developing novel approaches for recognizing and categorizing physical parts. The ultimate objective is to release an open-source solution, hardware and software, capable of converting waste materials into a functional inventory. The project's core ambition is to establish a circular marketplace, reimagining how we manage resources and promote sustainability.
